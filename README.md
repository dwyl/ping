## Why?

We have _several_ demo/example/tutorial Apps deployed to Heroku.
Apps on the "free" tier go to sleep after **30 minutes** of inactivity.
see: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours

In order to wake them,
we wrote a few lines of code that can be added to any
Elixir/Phoenix App and invoked as an image
in the `README.md` of the project that links to the App.

We had implemented the "wake from sleep" endpoint
several times in our Heroku Apps,
most recently in our
[`email`](https://github.com/dwyl/email/blob/b4c2c4f4d96773c326cf3fa8cd4838973c9a78f5/lib/app_web/controllers/sent_controller.ex#L113-L170)
app.
After copy-pasting the code a couple of times,
we decided to make it a DRY reusable package
that we can use in our _next_ app(s)!

## What?

An easy way for us to wake our Heroku demo apps.


> Note: our use case for this module is "just in time" waking of Heroku dynos. <br />
If you need your "Free" Heroku app to be _always_ awake
or awake during specific times of day,
consider _combining_ the `ping` package with a CRON job.
You can use a _free_ service such as: https://cron-job.org
as described by [Mahdhi Rezvi](https://github.com/Mahdhir) in:
https://medium.com/better-programming/keeping-my-heroku-app-alive-b19f3a8c3a82


## Who?

This package is for anyone building
an Elixir/Phoenix app deployed to Heroku.


# How?

## 1. Installation

Install by adding `ping` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ping, "~> 1.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

## 2. Create a `get /ping` Route in your `router.ex`





##Â 3. Create the `ping/2` Function in your Controller

You can either create a brand new controller,
or use an existing one if you prefer.  



## 4. Add a GIF to the `README.md` of the Heroku App
